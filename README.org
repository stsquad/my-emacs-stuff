#+TITLE: Alex's Emacs Configuration


[[https://travis-ci.org/stsquad/my-emacs-stuff][https://travis-ci.org/stsquad/my-emacs-stuff.png?branch=master]]

* Introduction

This is my Emacs, there are many like it but this is my own. My emacs
configuration is my best friend. It is my digital life. I must master
it as I master my life. Without me this configuration is probably
useless. Without my configuration I am certainly less effective.[fn:1]

* Usage

*I* bootstrap this together with my dotfiles via a script [[https://github.com/stsquad/dotfiles/blob/master/bootstrap.sh][sourced from
the internet]]. *You* probably shouldn't do that. This is mainly an
amalgem of different hacks acquired over time crafted to my specific
workflow. It is not intended to be a framework and it tends to break a
lot as I am an inveterate tinkerer. However I have put it up on the
internet because I find reading other people configurations useful and
hopefully others will find this useful. I certainly don't expect
anyone else to use this *as is*.

** Notes on dependencies

In the dark before times I had all sorts of conditional logic and
spaghetti like dependencies. However the world of emacs has improved
over the years and we now have things like [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] which make
keeping configurations coherent a lot easier. Most individual packages
are now configured in their own /use-package/ stanzas. Some of the
other libraries I use:

 - Mangnar Sven's excellent [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash]] list library
 - Jonas Bernoulli's superlative [[https://magit.vc/][git porcelien Magit]]
 - Jorgen Sch√§fer's [[https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy][elpy]] Python environment
 - Justin Burkett's super handy [[https://github.com/justbur/emacs-which-key][which-key]] prompt

And countless other dedicated hackers who have written and published
numerous excellent packages available with the official Emacs and the
wonderful [[https://melpa.org/][Melpa]] package repository.

** My extensions

I have written a few packages myself - some more actively maintained
than others. These include:

  - [[https://github.com/stsquad/emacs_chrome][Edit with Emacs]], for editing textareas in your browser with Emacs
  - [[https://github.com/stsquad/dired-rsync][dired-rsync]], trigger asynchronous rsync from /dired-mode/, useful
    for copying large files without hanging emacs

* Copying

It has a cobbled heritage from various sites and wikis and it is
probably safest to assume the code is all either GPL or Public Domain.
Feel free to use whatever bits may be of use to you in these files
that it is my right to license ;-)
