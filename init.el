;;; init.el --- Alex Benn√©e's .emacs
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is my Emacs, there are many like it but this is my own.
;; It is mainly an amalgem of different hacks acquired over time
;; which I use on many of the machines I work with.
;;
;; It has a cobbled heritage from various sites and wikis and it is
;; probably safest to assume the code is all either GPL or Public
;; Domain.  Feel free to use whatever bits may be of use to you in these
;; files that it is my right to license ;-)
